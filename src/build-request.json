  "requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-46",
      "text": "Add a small, non-intrusive front-page greeting/tooltip that helps users notice the existing Secretary widget and provides an obvious action to open it.",
      "target": "frontend",
      "source": {
        "messageIds": [
          "msg-3"
        ],
        "quotes": [

      },
      "acceptanceCriteria": [
        "A small greeting/tooltip is visible somewhere in the main app shell (e.g., near the header actions area and/or near the floating Secretary button) when the user first visits or until dismissed.",
        "The greeting/tooltip includes an explicit, English call-to-action that references the existing Secretary feature (e.g., \"Need help? Click Secretary to get started.\") and provides a clickable control that opens the Secretary widget.",
        "The greeting/tooltip can be dismissed by the user and stays dismissed for that user across page reloads (client-side persistence is acceptable).",
        "All user-facing text in the greeting/tooltip is in English.",
        "The greeting/tooltip styling uses existing Tailwind + shadcn components/tokens and matches the established civic theme (no new color palette).",
        "The greeting/tooltip is accessible: keyboard-operable controls, visible focus states, and appropriate aria-labels for icon-only dismiss/close controls (if used)."

    }
  ],
  "constraints": [
    "Frontend must remain React + TypeScript with Tailwind, shadcn components, and React Query patterns.",
    "Do not edit files under frontend/src/components/ui (read-only); compose existing components instead.",
    "Keep all user-facing text in English."
  ],
  "nonGoals": [
    "Do not change the Secretary widget conversation flows, option routing behavior, or backend logic.",
    "Do not introduce AI/LLM integrations or any external services.",
    "Do not add new authentication or authorization behavior."
