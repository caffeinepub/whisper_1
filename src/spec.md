# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Revert the entire application (frontend + backend) back to the exact state of Draft 38.

**Planned changes:**
- Restore the codebase to match Draft 38 exactly, removing any changes introduced after Draft 38.
- Ensure the reverted Draft 38 version builds successfully for both frontend and backend.

**User-visible outcome:** The app’s UI and behavior match Draft 38 as previously deployed/reviewed, with no post–Draft 38 changes remaining.
