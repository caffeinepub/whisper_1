# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Update the homepage hero to use a warmer/neutral real-life community collaboration photo, tune the hero overlay for readability without over-darkening, and fix teal CTA contrast (including the header “Get Started” button).

**Planned changes:**
- Replace the current hero background with the updated warm/neutral community collaboration image and ensure the latest asset always loads reliably on refresh (avoid stale/cached hero image via versioned/updated asset reference).
- Adjust the hero overlay gradient tint toward warm/neutral and tune opacity so the photo remains visible while keeping headline and description readable across mobile and desktop.
- Update CTA/button styles to ensure the header “Get Started” button never renders white-on-white and align primary CTAs to the existing teal accent tokens with consistent hover/active/focus-visible states.

**User-visible outcome:** The homepage hero displays a warm/neutral real-life community collaboration photo consistently, the overlay looks more natural while preserving text readability, and the header/hero CTAs have clear teal-forward styling with proper contrast and interaction states.
