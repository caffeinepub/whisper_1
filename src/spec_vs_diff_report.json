  "summary": "REQ-3 appears implemented via HomeHeader background set to solid black. Geography validation work is partially evident (interaction flags, validity computation, error-clearing), but the diff is truncated so key acceptance criteria for REQ-1/REQ-2 (ability to attempt submit for feedback, inline error text/highlighting behavior) cannot be confirmed. REQ-4 is partially evidenced (exact URL + preload hook), but bottom-justified background positioning and loading fallback cannot be verified from the provided snippet.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Ensure the user can trigger validation feedback even if the form is otherwise incomplete (i.e., do not create a disabled-only dead end).",
      "reason": "The diff shows `canSubmit` requires instanceName, description, `isGeographyValid`, name availability, and not submitting; this commonly drives a disabled submit button. The submit/attempt handler behavior is truncated, so it cannot be confirmed that users can still attempt submission to see validation messages when other fields are incomplete.",

      "requirement": "Show a clear inline English validation message in the Create Instance Proposal card on submit attempt, and visually highlight the missing geography field(s); clear the error when the user changes geography selection.",
      "reason": "State for `geographyError` and an effect clearing it on selection change are present, but the actual submit-attempt logic that sets the message, the exact English message strings, and the visual highlighting of missing fields are in truncated portions and not verifiable from the diff excerpt.",

      "requirement": "Bottom-justify the hero background image (e.g., `background-position: center bottom`) and show a fallback background color while loading, while keeping the existing preload-before-display logic.",
      "reason": "The exact image URL and preload hook usage are shown, but the hero section styling (background-position) and any loading fallback background color/conditional rendering are not present in the provided (truncated) App.tsx excerpt.",
