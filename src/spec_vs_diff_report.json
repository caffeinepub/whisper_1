  "summary": "The diff does not provide evidence of a full revert to the exact Draft 38 state; instead it shows ongoing/expanded functionality and documentation summaries consistent with post–Draft 38 changes. Several changes appear to add/describe features rather than strictly reverting to Draft 38.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Revert the current draft codebase back to the exact state of Draft 38 (frontend + backend), replacing any changes introduced after Draft 38.",
      "reason": "The diff shows only 4 modified files and includes substantial frontend/backend code and documentation-summary content that appears to describe/add functionality (e.g., Secretary navigation/portal integration, detailed geography-driven instance creation, multiple React Query hooks) rather than demonstrating removal of post–Draft 38 changes or restoring Draft 38 behavior/UI. There is no evidence in the provided diff summary that the codebase was returned to Draft 38 across both frontend and backend.",

  "hallucinated_features": [
    {
      "description": "Secretary navigation registry / deep-linking style navigation destinations and related UI wiring (register/navigate) added/retained in App shell.",
      "reason": "BuildRequest is strictly to revert to Draft 38 with no new features; the diff shows code establishing a navigation registry with multiple registered destinations and Secretary-related integration, which constitutes feature work unless it was already present in Draft 38 (not evidenced).",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/App.tsx"
      ]
    },
    {
      "description": "Expanded/changed product documentation and plans (architecture/phased plan/deployment/style guide) describing new system behaviors and design tokens.",
      "reason": "Non-goal prohibits introducing new features or content changes beyond restoring Draft 38; the modified summary file describes extensive documentation content and design system changes, which are not requested as part of a revert (and no evidence they are required for Draft 38).",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend-file-summaries.txt"
      ]
    },
    {
      "description": "Project state metadata update marking a new pending request (AR-1) and project state versioning changes.",
      "reason": "The BuildRequest is about reverting application code; updating project tracking metadata is not requested and may be extraneous to the revert.",
