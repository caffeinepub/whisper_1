  "summary": "Implemented a shared BackNav component and applied it across Feed, Geography, Tasks (list/detail/create), and Profile pages with a consistent container/header layout. Home “Get Started” CTA changes are implied via App.tsx and the diff summaries, but some back-control labeling consistency may not fully match the requested uniform pattern.",

      "requirement": "Use the same UI pattern (including consistent labeling) for backward navigation controls across Feed, Tasks, and Geography; Task detail and task create should keep their existing 'Back to List' behavior/pattern while matching shared styling.",
      "reason": "Task detail/create back controls use label=\"Back to Tasks\", while other pages use the default label \"Back\"; the request calls out consistent labeling/pattern, and explicitly references existing 'Back to List' on task detail/create.",
