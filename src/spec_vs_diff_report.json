  "summary": "The diff implements the proposals list and detail dialog with loading/empty/error states, adds approve/reject controls with success/error feedback, and adds backend + frontend mutation/query support for updating proposal status with pending-only validation and React Query invalidation. One additional, unrelated query hook (isParent) appears in the same hooks file.",

      "reason": "BuildRequest is specifically about Steps 8–9 for proposals UI + moderation status updates; parent-child relationship checks are outside that scope.",
