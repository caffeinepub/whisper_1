  "summary": "REQ-1 asks for updates to `frontend/docs/DEPLOYMENT.md` documenting a clean rebuild/redeploy procedure and troubleshooting. The diff does not show any direct change to `frontend/docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`; only `frontend-file-summaries.txt` and `project_state.json` were modified. Therefore the requested documentation update is not evidenced as implemented. Additionally, the diff introduces/updates project metadata and a broad set of unrelated frontend/doc changes described inside `frontend-file-summaries.txt`, which were not requested in the BuildRequest.",

      "reason": "The diff shows no modification to `frontend/docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`. The only modified files are `frontend-file-summaries.txt` and `project_state.json`, so there is no direct evidence that the deployment documentation itself was updated.",

      "reason": "These changes are not requested in the BuildRequest (which explicitly focuses on deployment documentation and lists non-goals about not changing UI/UX or adding new features).
