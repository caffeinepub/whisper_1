  "summary": "The diff clearly updates global CSS tokens and Tailwind color mappings toward a teal theme, and applies some teal-related classes in a UI component. However, the required new static hero image asset is not added (no new files), and the hero background change/bottom-justified positioning cannot be verified from the provided truncated App.tsx diff. There is also at least one instance of hard-coded color usage that goes against the token-driven intent.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-9",
      "requirement": "Add the new hero image as a static frontend asset under `frontend/public/assets/generated/` and reference it from the hero section implementation (do not serve the image from the backend).",
      "reason": "No new files were added in the diff, so the required static image file under `frontend/public/assets/generated/` is not present based on the provided change summary.",

      "requirement": "Replace the hero/header background image with the user-provided image and adjust the hero background positioning to be bottom-justified while preserving existing overlay and text readability.",
      "reason": "The hero implementation is presumably in `frontend/src/App.tsx`, but the diff for that file is truncated and the provided visible portion does not show the hero section/background styling or `background-position: bottom/center bottom`. Therefore the required change cannot be confirmed from available evidence.",

      "description": "Introduced a hard-coded OKLCH background color on the Secretary discoverability nudge card instead of relying purely on global tokens.",
      "reason": "The BuildRequest emphasizes token-driven teal accents and avoiding hard-coded color values to achieve teal styling; the diff adds a literal color value (`bg-[oklch(...)]`) rather than a token utility for that background.",
