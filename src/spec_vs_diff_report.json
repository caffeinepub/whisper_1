  "summary": "Core intent/slot type additions and classifier updates for create_task/find_tasks/update_task are present, along with new task execution helpers and slot prompts. However, the flow registry completion hooks for the new intents are placeholders (no trigger of create/list/update or navigation), and the diff summary does not provide sufficient evidence that the Secretary runtime fully wires slot-filling + completion execution from chat input end-to-end.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-4",
      "requirement": "Register the new intents in the intent flow registry with required/optional slots and a slot fill order, and define completion behavior hooks for each intent that trigger the corresponding task operation (create/list/update) or navigation.",
      "reason": "Flows are registered with requiredSlots/slotOrder, but each new intent's onComplete is explicitly a placeholder and does not call task operations or navigate.",

      "requirement": "Integrate the task intent system into the Secretary runtime so task intents are executed from chat input: classify, run slot-filling via flow runner, and on completion call existing task backend methods and present confirmation/results in chat.",
      "reason": "Although task execution helpers (taskExecutor/taskIntentActions) are added and FlowEngineBrain is modified to import them, the provided diff snippet for FlowEngineBrain is truncated before showing the actual chat-input handling, slot-filling loop, and completion invocation that would call createTask/listTasksByLocation/getTask+updateTask and print results.",
