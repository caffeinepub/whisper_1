  "summary": "REQ-2’s core behavior (store selected File in state, update via onChange, clear on successful submit, and no upload/payload changes) appears implemented in PostComposer.tsx, but the change is not atomic to a single file as required; two additional files were modified.",

      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Changes are limited to this single file: `frontend/src/components/feed/PostComposer.tsx`.",

      "reason": "The BuildRequest’s scope is minimal state handling only; adding new UI messaging is not requested and goes beyond the stated atomic change.",
