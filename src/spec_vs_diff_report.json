  "summary": "REQ-1 appears implemented in App hero via a direct external image URL with preloading/fallback logic and an intended 25% dark-blue overlay + bottom-justified background positioning. REQ-2 is partially implemented: the create-instance flow now passes the submitted proposal name upward and ProposalsSection can auto-open a specified proposal, but the diff summary does not clearly evidence React Query invalidation/refresh wiring nor the follow-up UI entry point from the proposal detail view. REQ-3 adds a smoke-test markdown doc, but it is largely a template with \"Observed Result\" fields left unfilled, so it does not yet record actual results.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "The proposals list reflects the newly submitted proposal without requiring a full page reload (react-query invalidation/refresh behavior is wired and verified).",
      "reason": "The diff shows navigation wiring (proposalToOpen auto-open) but does not show the submit mutation invalidating/refetching the proposals query or otherwise guaranteeing the newly submitted proposal appears without reload.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "From the newly created proposal detail view, the user can reach the instance-dependent follow-up UI that already exists (e.g., the issue project/tasks flow) for that proposal/instance identifier.",
      "reason": "The diff summary does not include the Proposal Detail implementation; therefore there is no direct evidence in the provided modified file snippets that the proposal detail view exposes a follow-up entry point (e.g., \"Open Issue Project\").",

      "requirement": "Record the end-to-end smoke test steps and the observed result for each step in a repo document, including performing at least one instance-dependent follow-up action and noting any failures/fixes or known issues.",
      "reason": "The added smoke test document includes detailed steps and expected results, but the \"Observed Result\" sections are left as \"_To be filled during manual testing_\" (i.e., results were not recorded).",
