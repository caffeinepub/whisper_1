  "summary": "Diff implements new global theme tokens and adds a warm/neutral `.hero-overlay` utility plus new CTA utility classes, but it also introduces unrelated Secretary navigation/deep-link logic changes and does not provide clear evidence of the new hero image asset/caching changes required by REQ-1.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Update the homepage hero background image to a real-life community collaboration photograph with a warmer/neutral overall color balance, and ensure the hero section renders the updated asset reliably (no stale/cached image on refresh).",
      "reason": "The diff shows no new/changed image asset file (no files added) and the `App.tsx` change is truncated, so there is insufficient evidence that the hero background references the new warm image filename/version for cache-busting and that object-cover/full-bleed behavior is preserved.",
      "evidence": [
        "<file-diff>: Added: 0 (no new image asset present)",
        "frontend/src/App.tsx (truncated)"
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "REQ-3",
      "requirement": "Fix CTA/button styling issues so the header \"Get Started\" button is never white text on a white (or near-white) background, and refine CTA buttons to a colorful teal-forward palette consistent with the existing accent tokens and hover/focus states.",
      "reason": "While new CTA utility classes are introduced in `index.css`, the `App.tsx` diff is truncated and does not provide direct evidence that the header \"Get Started\" button specifically uses these classes or otherwise has guaranteed contrast in both light/dark modes, including hover/active/focus-visible states.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/index.css (truncated): `.cta-primary` utility introduced",
        "frontend/src/App.tsx (truncated): header/button usage not fully visible"
      ]
    }
  ],
  "hallucinated_features": [
    {
      "description": "Secretary navigation registry and deep-link handling logic added/modified in App component.",
      "reason": "BuildRequest explicitly lists \"No changes to Secretary navigation/deep-linking logic\" as a non-goal, but `App.tsx` shows new imports and logic using `useSecretaryNavigationRegistry` and `parseDeepLink`, and registers navigation destinations and handles deep links on mount.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/App.tsx (truncated): imports `useSecretaryNavigationRegistry`, `parseDeepLink`; registers destinations; handles deep links"
      ]
    },
    {
      "description": "Global theme/token overhaul (OKLCH token values for many CSS variables) beyond hero/overlay/button refinements.",
      "reason": "The request is narrowly scoped to hero image/overlay and CTA contrast fixes; `index.css` modifies a large set of global CSS variables (background, foreground, card, popover, secondary, muted, border, etc.) for both light and dark mode, which is broader than the requested visual refinements.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/index.css (truncated): extensive `:root` and `.dark` variable changes"
      ]
    },
    {
      "description": "New Tailwind theme extensions (glow shadows, animations/keyframes, additional color variants) not explicitly requested.",
      "reason": "The BuildRequest does not ask for new animation/glow utilities; `tailwind.config.js` adds glow shadows and keyframes/animations (fade-in-up/fade-in) and extends palette variants.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/tailwind.config.js: `boxShadow.glow`, `boxShadow.glow-lg`, `keyframes`, `animation` additions"
